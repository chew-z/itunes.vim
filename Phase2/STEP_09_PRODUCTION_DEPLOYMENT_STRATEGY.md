# Step 9: Production Deployment and Migration Strategy

Implement production deployment strategy with safe migration path and rollback capabilities:

## Tasks

1. **Create deployment configuration in `deploy/`**:
   - Environment-specific configuration files
   - Database backup and restore scripts
   - Migration runbooks with validation steps
   - Rollback procedures for each component

2. **Add feature flag system in `config/`**:
   - Runtime configuration for enabling database mode
   - Gradual rollout controls (percentage-based enabling)
   - A/B testing framework for performance comparison
   - Configuration validation and hot-reload support

3. **Implement backup and recovery in `backup/`**:
   - Automated SQLite database backup scheduling
   - Point-in-time recovery capabilities
   - Export/import tools for database portability
   - Validation tools for backup integrity

4. **Add monitoring and alerting in `monitoring/`**:
   - Database health check endpoints
   - Performance metric collection and reporting
   - Error rate alerting for critical failures
   - Usage analytics and performance trending

5. **Create migration tools for production in `migration/`**:
   - Safe migration orchestrator with validation steps
   - Parallel operation support (database + cache running simultaneously)
   - Migration progress monitoring and reporting
   - Automatic rollback triggers for performance degradation

6. **Add comprehensive documentation**:
   - Update CLAUDE.md with production deployment guide
   - Create troubleshooting runbook for common issues
   - Document performance tuning recommendations
   - Add operational procedures for database maintenance

## Requirements

- Migration must be reversible at any point
- System must support running in hybrid mode (cache + database)
- Performance monitoring must detect degradation automatically
- Rollback procedures must be tested and validated
- Documentation must be complete and accurate for production operations

## Success Criteria

✅ Deployment configuration is complete and tested  
✅ Feature flag system enables safe rollouts  
✅ Backup and recovery procedures work correctly  
✅ Monitoring detects issues automatically  
✅ Migration tools support hybrid mode operation
